# TCSR- Thermal Comfort Sensing Rig - interface board PCB

This project is developing a device to collect Thermal comfort data in an indoor office environment, as part of the PhD thesis of Adam Tyler. It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

Files used to generate printed circuit board used to interface between Rasperry Pi, power management board, and the various sensors.
